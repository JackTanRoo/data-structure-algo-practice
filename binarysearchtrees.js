// tree is a new type of data structure

// data structure that consists fo ndoes in a parent/child relationship

// lists are linear but trees are non linear eg tree has multiple paths

// singly linked list is like a linear version of a tree

// but a tree must only have parent child relationships for nodes. child nodes cannot point to parent nodes or ndoes at the parent level, that is not a tree it is a graph

// tree only have 1 root

// applicaitons for trees
	// HTML this is a tree
	// 


// binary search trees

// excel at searching and retrieval of data

// rules about BST
// each node only has 2 children at most, you can also only have 1
// sorted - left side is smaller than the parent, right is bigger
