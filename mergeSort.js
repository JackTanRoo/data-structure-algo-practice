// merge sort

// split unsorted array until you have individual element in its own array of 1 element

// then join the the sorted individual arrays into arrays of 2 but in sorted order

// then merge the arrays of 2 into sorted arrays of 4


// key splits

// split into 1s

// sort

// merge sorted arrays into larger arrays



// STEP 1

// implement merge - which takes 2 sorted arrays, then creates joint result array of sorted elements
