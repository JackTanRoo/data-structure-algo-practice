// 1 clarify the problem

	// 1 - what is the gioal
	// 2 - can i restate the problem in my own words
	// 3 - what should be the inputs
	// 4 - what should be the outputs
	// 5 - how can i label the data

// 2 explore concrete examples

	// help provide sanity checks
	// help you understand the problem better

	// start with some simple examples with simple inputs and outputs
	// then
	// - simple
	// - complex
	// - empty outputs
	// - outlier / invalid outputs

// 3 break it down

	// Write the high level detail of your solution

// 4 Solve the problem or simplify it

	// dont get stuck on a difficult part of the problem

	// if you think there is some hard part that you don't know how to start

	// ignore the hard part first

	// start writing the code for the simple part

	// then incorporate the difficult part later on

// 5 Look back and refactor the code

	// This is the most important, dont just stop after your code works

	// Questions
	// 	Can you derive the result differently using another approach
	// 	Is it understandable at a glance
	// 	Can you use the method for other problem?
	// 	Can you improve the performance?
	// 	Can you think of ways to refactor?
	// 	How have others solved this problem?


// PATTERNS

// Frequency counter
	// always try to avoid nested loops - O(N^2)
